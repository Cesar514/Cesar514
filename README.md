# Hi, I’m Cesar (@Cesar514)

I build robots and algorithms for places where humans should not have to go. I am a PhD researcher in robotics working on nuclear decommissioning, variable autonomy, and shared control for mobile manipulators. Most of my work lives at the intersection of human decision making and robot precision: how to let a human stay in the loop, while the robot handles as much of the risk and complexity as possible.

My background is in Mechatronics Engineering and in Computational Neuroscience & Cognitive Robotics, so I tend to think about robots the way I think about brains: as systems that perceive, predict, and act under uncertainty. I work on intent prediction, teleoperation, and mobile manipulation, often with AR/VR interfaces and 3D reconstruction, to help operators work naturally in hazardous or constrained environments.

I am interested in augmented and virtual reality, AI, automation, electronics, human–robot interaction, the brain, and dreams. The projects you will find in this profile range from ROS and ROS 2 stacks for mobile manipulators, to perception and intent-prediction pipelines in Python, to experiments in Unity, Flutter, and other tools I use to explore new interfaces between humans and machines.

At the core, I care about building systems that help humanity solve real problems rather than just produce demos. If you are working on something that moves in the physical world, augments human capability, or pushes how we think about control and autonomy, I would be happy to talk.
